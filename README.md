## Happiness

My top goal as a manager is to do my best to enable my team to be happy. This involves building a great culture where we celebrate wins, care for each other, feel a sense of shared goals, and aligning the goals of the team with the goals of the individual. Aligning goals includes:

- Finding the right people for the team
- Helping people be excited about things that will drive the team goals (aligning the work to interests and growth, making sure the right people are on the right projects, etc.)
- Making sure people have the opportunity to find fulfillment and growth in their work
- Give people the opportunities to continue learning and growing in the areas they are interested in, even if it means bending a few rules or finding a better place for them to achieve those goals

Health and family always come first. I will enable anyone to make sure they can prioritize this, do my best to support alternative work arrangements, and fully support any leave.

Finally - PTO is time that you earned, you should feel comfortable taking this at any time and I will do whatever I can to support this.

## Ownership

**Note:** By ownership I mean owning the _outcomes_ and the _process_ not just the _execution_.

I believe the best most enjoyable and impactful work comes when people have ownership and autonomy over the work they are doing. This requires a lot of goal setting, context sharing, education and training, etc. Ownership means moving from asking what to do → giving options and asking which to take → sharing the plan, what options were considers, and why you chose the option you did.

This goes hand-in-hand with [Servant Leadership](https://Servant leadership) and [Upside Down Management](https://professionalgrowthsystems.com/leadership/upside-down-management-john-timpson/).

Ownership is challenging - over time I will increase (or decrease) the scope of ownership to what is suitable for each person. I also support this by filling the gap.

## Fill the Gap

The best way to grow people is to give them challenges that are just beyond their current capabilities and then support them to make sure the outcomes are successful. The &quot;gap&quot; is the set of tasks between current capabilities and the requirements of the projects, this gap is support/filled by either managers or other technical leaders and over time that gap continues to shrink. It&#39;s important that as you fill this gap you also share the work you&#39;re doing along with the process you&#39;re following and reasons you&#39;re doing it so others can take this on in the future.

## Celebrate Wins, Work on Misses

When people on my team achieve wins I will directly attach their name to any announcement and when I&#39;m talking x-functionally or upwards. When there are misses/mistakes I will take responsibility for this and will not attach individuals names on these - we will work on the growth areas together.

Making mistakes is an important part of growth and as such should not be feared or discouraged to the point where people will not longer take risks - that said continuing to make the same mistakes is a sign that people are not learning or growing as needed (or could be a sign that gaps are not being filled, the right feedback is not being given, or the challenges are too large).

## Make Myself Redundant

Any time I&#39;m not needed in a room, decision or on a project that&#39;s a huge win. There are many more challenges out there that I can take on. If each person is able to have full ownership and autonomy then I can and will step back (but always be available if needed).

## Discord People

My general values align super strongly with the Discord values, this alignment was a huge part of why I joined the company. Go check those out if you&#39;re not already familiar.

# How I Grow People

There are a lot of ways that I work to help people grow, the main areas are:

- Find challenges that continue to stretch people - this is often pattern matching skills and interests with projects in the team and across the company
- Support those challenges by via Fill the Gap
- Give consistent timely feedback on how things can continue to improve and recognizing the great things people are doing

# What I Care About

## Always Be Hungry

Always be striving to be better, make more impact, move faster, etc. Reflect on everything you do to learn how you could do it better next time and how you could achieve your goals without the help/guidance you got from others.

Don&#39;t be satisfied with the status quo, always be looking for ways for you to growth yourself, improve your team, and drive impact to the company.

Push yourself outside of your comfort zone.

## Enjoy the Journey

Celebrate your wins, enjoy making mistakes and learning from them, hold yourself to a high standard but don&#39;t dwell on mistakes. It&#39;s very easy to interpret &quot;Always Be Hungry&quot; with never feeling happy about what you&#39;re able to achieve, this is the opposite of what I encourage.

## Measure and Use Data

The best way to make sure you're doing the right thing and you're making improvements is by measuring. Every initiative should start out with making sure you understand the problem, opportunity, size and then you measure your impact. It's very easy to be moving in the wrong direction and not realizing.

## Care for Others

Make sure others around you are healthy and happy. Support each other to achieve their goals. Helping others is not only the right thing to do but also will help you grow as a person.

## Move Fast

Be innovative and scrappy, think big and make changes incrementally, make [two-way-door](https://shit.management/one-way-and-two-way-door-decisions/) decisions quickly.
